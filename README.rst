Setting up a slave
------------------

- Please send an email to buildbot-master@leap.se requesting a
  password, and stating which OS are you running (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X,
  Windows) and which version.
- In a nutshell:
  - If you are going to run the slave in a GNU/Linux or a Mac
    operating system, then what you need to do is `this
    <http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/DownloadInstall#SlaveinVirtualenv>`_
  - If you're going to run it in a Microsft Windows system, then `go
    here <http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/RunningBuildbotOnWindows>`_

- For more information, and since we're using the latest version of
  Buildbot, please read `creating a slave
  <http://docs.buildbot.net/latest/manual/installation.html#creating-a-buildslave>`_
